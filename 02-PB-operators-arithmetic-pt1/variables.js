/* Declare two variables "x" and "y" and assign them number values.

Add x and y.

Subtract y from x. Then, subtract x from y.

Multiply x and y.

Divide x by y.

Declare another variable "z" with value "10". Multiply x and y. Then, divide the result by z. Store the result in a new variable named "resultOne". Print "resultOne" to the console.

Declare two variables: "a" with value 15, and "b" with value 9. Divide a by b.

Declare another variable "c" with value 20. Add a and b, then multiply the result by c. Store the result in variable "resultTwo". Print "resultTwo" to the console.

Increment a.

Decrement b.

Subtract a from b and store this in a new variable "d". Add d and c.

Print the remainder when "resultOne" is divided by "resultTwo" to the console. */
